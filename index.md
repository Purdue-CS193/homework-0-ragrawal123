## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown 2
# Raunak's First CS193 Homework
- I really like how the instructors in CS193 care enough to make sure everyone in the class gets along
- I really like how the instructors incorporate some fun activities during the lecture to give us a break from the stress of attending multiple lectures 
- I actually really like the CS193 class in general because it will teach me a lot of stuff that is useful in computer science that I did not know before such as terminal commands etc. that will make my life easier as a computer scientist
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
